This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Nanodegree React Native course.

A front-end application called 'readable' was created from scratch to provide a Reddit-like application where users can create Posts, Comments, and Voting.

The application was built primarly using React Native, Expo, React Navigation, and Redux.
