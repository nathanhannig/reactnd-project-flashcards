# Mobile Flashcards
This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Nanodegree React Native course.

A create-react-native-app application was created from scratch to provide a mobile flashcard application where users can create Decks and Questions to quiz themselves on topics.

The application was built primarily using React Native, Expo, React Navigation, and Redux.
